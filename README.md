Welcome to Amen Tech's Computer Science Basics with JavaScript COurse! This repo is designed to go along with the official course at www.amentech.io

Each section has a folder name, and two files, an initial code file (called A), and a completed code file with the solution (called B). While following along you should try to implement solutions in the initial file to see if you can get the correct result by comparing with the completed code file. This course is organized into the following sections:


Section 1:
I. Pure Functions
II. Currying Functions
III. Function Composition

Section 2: Objects
I. Aggregation
II. Delegation
III. Concatenation
IV. Encapsulation

Section 3: Async Patterns
I. Callbacks
II.Promises
III. Events
IV. Streams


NOTE: THis course is being updated regularly, so this is not a complete list of all course content. Check back weekly for updates. Happy coding!
